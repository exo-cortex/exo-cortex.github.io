The the program is invoked via the &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo;-command.
Here is a list of useful commands for simple image manipulation like resizing, cropping or conversion from one format to another. This list exists , because I realized that I had to re-google some commands everytime I was using them.
conversion between formats $ convert input_image.png -quality 90 output_image.jpg # or set output format through &amp;#34;-format&amp;#34;-option $ convert input_image.</description></item><item><title>wavetable_synthesis_from_images</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/wavetable_synthesis_from_images/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 13:43:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/wavetable_synthesis_from_images/</guid><description>Any sound can become a tone if we repeat it very quickly. The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with 1 Hz the base frequency is 1 Hz - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to 50 Hz we can actually hear it.
wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat. The repetition rate becomes the base frequency.</description></item><item><title>oval_relatives</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/oval_relatives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 11:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/oval_relatives/</guid><description>[1] this shape is neither round nor oval. A few years back I experimented with shapes that are almost round, but not quite yet. Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above; would you immediately see that it isn&amp;rsquo;t round? Most people would expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</description></item><item><title>ffmpeg_scripts</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/how-to/ffmpeg_scripts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 20:09:19 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/how-to/ffmpeg_scripts/</guid><description>How to use ffmpeg.

One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item><item><title>advanced visualization studio</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 11:35:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</guid><description>A looooong time ago - 2006ish - I used AVS (Advanced Visualization Studio - a music visualization plugin that came with Winamp) to create nice visualizations of the music that was being played. AVS is a little programming environment that compiles your code everytime you change something. It was actually the first contact with coding I had. A very sparse community of coders around the world made very nice visualization presets.</description></item><item><title>rewriting_my_dde_solver</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 20:03:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/</guid><description>In the final months of writing my master thesis there was little time. Simultaneously a lot of problems in the c++ code that I had written became very apparent. Since then it has been a dream of me to rewrite the whole thing. Thereby learning even more C++ and also using git/github in a more professional manner (I used it before, but only locally and I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite adhere to a consistent way of commiting changes or wording the commit messages).</description></item><item><title>astrazeneka</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/astrazeneka/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 19:10:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/astrazeneka/</guid><description>Yesterday I got my vaccine.

The framework is KaTeX and it supports a variety of LaTeX math typesetting.
This enables me to write fomulas like these:
$$ z_{i}(t) = (\lambda + i\omega + \gamma |z_{i}(t)|^{2})z_{i}(t) + \sum_{j=0}^{N} \kappa_{i\leftarrow j} e^{i \phi_{i \leftarrow j}}z_{j}(t - \tau_{i\leftarrow j}) $$
It also allows to write math symbols like $\infty$ within text. This is pretty cool for things like $\tfrac{1}{3}$.</description></item><item><title>pitchescurves</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/pitchcurves/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 16:43:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/pitchcurves/</guid><description>idea: creating sound from pure functions.
The most elemental wave-forms are sine functions.
the pitch of a tone defined over time. Every sound in nature can be deconstructed into a collection of sine functions. A single sine function can only be deconstructed into itself and is therefor called &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;.
Some years ago I had the idea of constructing &amp;ldquo;sound emoji&amp;rdquo; - abstract representations of emotions through sound.</description></item></channel></rss>
