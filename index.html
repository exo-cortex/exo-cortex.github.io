With the help of the official repository 3 putting images on the the display is quite easy. The repository also has code for other e-ink-displays from pimoroni.
The image transition looks quite elaborate and takes about 30 seconds of flashing through different colors. But eventually it looks quite interesting. With the limited range of colors everything looks a little like an art print with intentionally noticeable dithering artifacts 4.&mldr;</div><a href=/blog/inky_impressions/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/new_job/>new_job / dark matter</a></h1><time>Sep 30, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Last month I started working at Dark Matter in Berlin. Dark matter is an exhibition space showing various kinetic audiovisual art-pieces conceived by Christopher Bauder. They mostly use special DMX-controlled winches to move glowing light-elements precisely up and down. Collectively the winches create moving and morphing objects in space in sync with musical soundscapes. My favourite pieces there involve precicely moving objects in order to create moving objects that take up space.&mldr;</div><a href=/blog/new_job/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/variable_density_point_distributions/>variable density point distributions</a></h1><time>Jun 28, 2021</time><br><div class=description>I finally implemented my own version of the poisson disk sampling algorithm. The standard algorithm places points on a 2D plane with a minimum distance $d_{min}$ between them until there is no more space for additional points. The distribution of the distances of adjacent points is a poisson distribution - hence the name. Robert Bridson described an efficient algorithm to create these samplings 1. It uses a grid to store the points in them.&mldr;</div><a href=/blog/variable_density_point_distributions/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/>advanced visualization studio</a></h1><time>May 30, 2021</time><br><div class=description>A looooooong time ago in the year 2006 I began to play around with AVS. Advanced Visualization Studio came as a plugin with the famous Winamp Media player. Winamp had 2 plugins that rendered colorful procedural art that reacted to the music. These music visualization plugins were &ldquo;Milkdrop&rdquo; and &ldquo;AVS&rdquo;. Typically the user would choose from a variety of presets that would then visualize the sound. But in AVS users could actually create their own presets.&mldr;</div><a href=/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/>rewriting_my_dde_solver</a></h1><time>May 29, 2021</time><br><div class=description>In the final months of writing my master thesis there was little time. Simultaneously a lot of problems in the c++ code that I had written became very apparent. Since then it has been a dream of me to rewrite the whole thing. Thereby learning even more C++ and also using git/github in a more professional manner (I used it before, but only locally and I didn&rsquo;t quite adhere to a consistent way of commiting changes or wording the commit messages).&mldr;</div><a href=/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/exo-cortex title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|2021 <a href=https://github.com/exo-cortex/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
