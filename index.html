The shelf should be irregular in its compartment sizes with some of them sticking out more. It shall be really big as to finally store ALL(tm) my stuff that otherwise just lies around all the time.
I began rewriting a python script and put it on github [1]. The script will be updated.

1. changing the way mass accumulates. &ldquo;Mass tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells mass how to move." John Wheeler
In out universe there is a bi-directional relationship between mass and space. Both influence each other: Mass creates a potential $V(x,y,z)$ which is defined for each point in space and the gradient of the potential $\nabla V$ tells us in which direction gravitational pull is moving this mass.&mldr;</div><a href=/projects/worldbuilding_with_reaction_diffusion_potentials/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/projects/wavetable_synthesis_from_images/>wavetable synthesis with images</a></h1><time>Jun 2, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Any sound can become a tone if we repeat it very quickly. The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with 1 Hz the base frequency is 1 Hz - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to 50 Hz we can actually hear it.
wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat. The repetition rate becomes the base frequency.&mldr;</div><a href=/projects/wavetable_synthesis_from_images/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/projects/oval_relatives/>oval_relatives</a></h1><time>May 31, 2021</time><br><div class=description>[1] this shape is neither round nor oval. A few years back I experimented with shapes that are almost round, but not quite yet. Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above; would you immediately see that it isn&rsquo;t round? Most people would expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.&mldr;</div><a href=/projects/oval_relatives/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/projects/reaction_diffusion/>reaction_diffusion_systems</a></h1><time>May 30, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.&mldr;</div><a href=/projects/reaction_diffusion/>Read more ⟶</a></section><ul class=pagination><span class="page-item page-prev"></span><span class="page-item page-next"><a href=/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>Next →</span></a></span></ul></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/exo-cortex title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|2021 <a href=https://github.com/exo-cortex/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
