The goal will be to reimplement the features of the old solver, but in a more modular and flexible manner. The features of the old DDE solver were:</p><ul><li>construction of networks as a collection of edges with individual coupling weights, phases and delays</li><li>implementation of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart%E2%80%93Landau_equation>Stuart-Landau system</a></li><li>integration of the delay-coupled systems with runge-kutta 4th order method</li><li>analysis of the timeseries - finding extrema</li><li>saving timeseries in a simplified manner to dramatically save space [<strong>RDP</strong>]</li><li>measuring (non-)linear reservoir computing performances via Legendre-Polynomials [<strong>DAM12</strong>]</li></ul><p>Additional features that shall be in the new solver:</p><ul><li>adaptive refinement of the parameter space when scanning</li><li>implementation and easy changing of advanced dynamical systems e.g. <strong>Lang-Kobayashi</strong>, <strong>Lorenz-sytem</strong>, <strong>RÃ¶ssler-System</strong> and more.</li></ul><hr><p>[<strong>RDP</strong>] using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm>Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm</a></p><p>[<strong>DAM12</strong>] <em>Dambre, J., Verstraeten, D., Schrauwen, B. et al.</em> <strong>Information Processing Capacity of Dynamical Systems</strong>.
