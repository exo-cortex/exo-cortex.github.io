AVS is a little programming environment that compiles your code everytime you change something. It was actually the first contact with coding I had. A very sparse community of coders around the world made very nice visualization presets.</description></item><item><title>rewriting_my_dde_solver</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 20:03:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/rewriting_my_dde_solver/</guid><description>In the final months of writing my master thesis there was little time. Simultaneously a lot of problems in the c++ code that I had written became apparent. It has been a dream to rewrite the whole thing thereby learning more c++ and also using git/github in a more professional manner. I
In my master thesis I investigated the nonlinear dynamics of different networks of delay-coupled oscillators and compared their ability to perform computations.</description></item><item><title>astrazeneka</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/astrazeneka/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 19:10:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/astrazeneka/</guid><description>Yesterday I got my vaccine. Finally. Last night and since I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling quite under the weather. Slight fever, a pumping headache and general drowsiness seems to be part of the general experience. Tomorrow should be better.</description></item><item><title>github first use</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/github-first-use/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 21:52:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/github-first-use/</guid><description>How to initialize git repository, add files, commit changes and push to existing github repository:

This enables me to write fomulas like these:
$$ z_{i}(t) = (\lambda + i\omega + \gamma |z_{i}(t)|^{2})z_{i}(t) + \sum_{j=0}^{N} \kappa_{i\leftarrow j} e^{i \phi_{i \leftarrow j}}z_{j}(t - \tau_{i\leftarrow j}) $$</description></item></channel></rss>
