AVS is a little programming environment that compiles your code everytime you change something. It was actually the first contact with coding I had. A very sparse community of coders around the world made very nice visualization <em>presets</em>.
Unknowingly I came into contact with a lot of concepts that I would later learn the names of in my physics studies. In AVS I dealt with <em>vector fields</em>, <em>numerical integration</em> via the euler-method, <em>matrix-multiplications</em> (for rotations), <em>bezier-curves</em> [1], <em>reaction-diffusion-systems</em> and (somehow related) <em>phase-oscillators</em> which later became central in my bachelor- and master-thesis.</p><p><video class=video-shortcode preload=false controls loop width=200>
