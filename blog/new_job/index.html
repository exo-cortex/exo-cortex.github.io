My favourite pieces there involve precicely moving objects in order to create moving objects that take up space. Together with a small team I keep track of various tech-related day-to-day-tasks; from starting the system, keeping an eye on the various pieces during the day to shutting it down again. During the off-days maintenance keeps us busy.</p><p>One benefit of this work place is the possibility to make very unique photographs.<br><img src=/img/grid_foggy_ceiling.jpg alt="grid ceiling"> The shows the ceiling view with open smoke flaps in order to clear the hall from fog.</p><p>The red wave is just one example of what the <strong>GRID</strong> can look like.
