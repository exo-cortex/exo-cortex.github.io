The most elemental wave-forms are sine functions.
  a simple sine function.   Every sound in nature can be deconstructed into a collection of sine functions. A single sine function can only be deconstructed into itself and is therefor called &ldquo;pure&rdquo;.
Some years ago I had the idea of constructing &ldquo;sound emoji&rdquo; - abstract representations of emotions through sound. The idea was to create short sound of ~1s that can deliver an emotion with the most basic means."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:title" content="pitchescurves"><meta property="og:description" content="idea: creating sound from pure functions.
