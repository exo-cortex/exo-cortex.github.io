Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$

The most elemental wave-forms are sine functions.
a simple sine function. Every sound in nature can be deconstructed into a collection of sine functions. A single sine function can only be deconstructed into itself and is therefor called &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;.
Some years ago I had the idea of constructing &amp;ldquo;sound emoji&amp;rdquo; - abstract representations of emotions through sound. The idea was to create short sound of ~1s that can deliver an emotion with the most basic means.</description></item></channel></rss>
