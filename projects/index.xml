The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with 1 Hz the base frequency is 1 Hz - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to 50 Hz we can actually hear it.
wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat. The repetition rate becomes the base frequency.</description></item><item><title>oval_relatives</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/oval_relatives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 11:15:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/oval_relatives/</guid><description>[1] this shape is neither round nor oval. {{ readFile &amp;ldquo;/static/img/curve_thing_dark.svg&amp;rdquo; | safeHTML }}
A few years back I experimented with shapes that are almost round, but not quite yet. Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above; would you immediately see that it isn&amp;rsquo;t round? Most people would expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</description></item><item><title>reaction_diffusion_systems</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:46:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</guid><description>Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item><item><title>pitchescurves</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/pitchcurves/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 16:43:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/pitchcurves/</guid><description>idea: creating sound from pure functions.
The most elemental wave-forms are sine functions.
the pitch of a tone defined over time. Every sound in nature can be deconstructed into a collection of sine functions. A single sine function can only be deconstructed into itself and is therefor called &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo;.
Some years ago I had the idea of constructing &amp;ldquo;sound emoji&amp;rdquo; - abstract representations of emotions through sound.</description></item></channel></rss>
