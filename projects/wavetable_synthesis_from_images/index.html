The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with <strong>1 Hz</strong> the base frequency is <strong>1 Hz</strong> - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to <strong>50 Hz</strong> we can actually hear it.</p><p>wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat. The repetition rate becomes the base frequency. Depending on the content of the sample the tone has a certain timbre. This way a synthesizer can recreate i.e. imitate the timbres of various instruments.</p><p>The real potential of wavetable synthesis lies in the interpolation between different samples while the sound is generated. This way the sound is &ldquo;morphing&rdquo; and constantly transitioning from one timbre to the next. This morphing can be done slowly or quickly, rhythmically or continuous. Dubstep often made use of these sounds.</p><p>Usually audio synthesis software comes with a collection of pre-made wavetables. My idea use images and use the brightness values over time as the wavefunction. In the animation below the three color channels (R, G, B) of the well-known <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna>Lenna</a> image are shown on the left. A closed path is used to read the pixel&rsquo;s brightness values at each point of the path. On the right the brightness values are shown. Since the image has three color channels we can extract 3 wave forms. This could make it possible for us to gain stereo-sounds from a simple image.</p><video class=video-shortcode preload=auto controls loop width=800>
