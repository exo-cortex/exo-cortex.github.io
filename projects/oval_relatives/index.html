Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above; would you immediately see that it isn&rsquo;t round? Most people would expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</p><h3 id=1-the-basic-shape>1. the basic shape</h3><p>The basic shape - the edge of the red area - is described by</p><p>$$
\mathbf{v}(\phi) = \begin{pmatrix}x(\phi) \\ y(\phi) \end{pmatrix} = \overbrace{(1 + f(\phi))}^{\text{radius}} \times \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \sin(\phi) \\ \cos(\phi) \end{pmatrix}}_{\text{unit circle}}.
$$</p><p>with $\phi \in [0,2\pi]$. If $f(\phi) = const$ i.e. $f'(\phi) = 0$ the shape $\mathbf{v}(\phi)$ becomes a perfect circle. If we now make the deviation of the radius a (small) function over $\phi$, we can simply create a shape like the one above. In my case I wanted to the deviation $f(\phi)$ to be a simple <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series><strong>Fourier series</strong></a> of only few components:</p><p>$$
f(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \sin(i\phi) + b_i \cos(i\phi)
$$
Alternatively we can describe $f$ as a sum of only sine-functions, each with its respective phase-offset $\theta$:
$$ f(\phi) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i \sin(i\phi + \theta_i) $$</p><h3 id=2-offset-curves>2. offset curves</h3><p>Graphic designers already now the concept of an &ldquo;offset curve&rdquo;, known in math as a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_curve>parallel curve</a>. If we draw parallel curves outside or inside our curve $\mathbf{v}$ we can make beautiful parallel curves $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, &mldr;$. The outer dark curve in [1] is such a parallel curve derived from the edge of the red shape.</p><p>To make things short, given the two functions $x(\phi)$ and $y(\phi)$ describing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a curve $\mathbf{v}(\phi)$ we can define the parallel curve $\mathbf{v}_d(\phi)$ with offset $o$ as</p><p>$$
\mathbf{v}_d(\phi) = \mathbf{v}(\phi) + d \times \overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \frac{ y'(\phi)}{\sqrt{x'(\phi)^2+y'(\phi)^2}} \\ \frac{ y'(\phi)}{\sqrt{x'(\phi)^2+y'(\phi)^2}} \end{pmatrix}}^{\text{orthonormal vector}}.
$$</p><p>In words: We follow the original curve $\mathbf{v}$ and at each point we go into the direction orthonormal - i.e. orthogonal/perpendicular <em>and</em> normalized to unit length of $1$ - to the tangent of the curve at that point.</p><hr><p><strong>todo</strong>:</p><ul><li>animation: wabbelgifs, increasing length of the series.</li></ul></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr><a class=soc href=https://github.com/exo-cortex title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>|2021 <a href=https://github.com/exo-cortex/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></footer><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
