The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with 1 Hz the base frequency is 1 Hz - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to 50 Hz we can actually hear it.
wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat. The repetition rate becomes the base frequency.</description></item></channel></rss>
