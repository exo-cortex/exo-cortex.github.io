I had to calculate the times each number represented and/or look them up somewhere else in the book. Recently I thought that a nice visualization of these scales might make a good bookmark that people could use.
I added a few time units as well as some extra pieces of information - like the time it takes for light to travel certain distances.</description></item></channel></rss>
