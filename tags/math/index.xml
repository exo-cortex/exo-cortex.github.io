A few years back I experimented with shapes that are almost round, but not quite yet. Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above; would you immediately see that it isn&amp;rsquo;t round? Most people would expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</description></item><item><title>reaction_diffusion_systems</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:46:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</guid><description>Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item><item><title>adding math to hugo</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/adding_math_to_hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 18:47:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/adding_math_to_hugo/</guid><description>with the help of this nice explanation I was able to add math-typesetting to my blog. The framework is KaTeX and it supports a variety of LaTeX math typesetting.
This enables me to write fomulas like these:
$$ z_{i}(t) = (\lambda + i\omega + \gamma |z_{i}(t)|^{2})z_{i}(t) + \sum_{j=0}^{N} \kappa_{i\leftarrow j} e^{i \phi_{i \leftarrow j}}z_{j}(t - \tau_{i\leftarrow j}) $$
It also allows to write math symbols like $\infty$ within text. This is pretty cool for things like $\tfrac{1}{3}$.</description></item></channel></rss>
