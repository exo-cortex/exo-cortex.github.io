Winamp came with 2 visualization plugins - Milkdrop and AVS. The music visualizations used input from the music to create procedural art. The user could choose from a variety of presets. With AVS users could create their own presets, because AVS is its own little programming environment. As it compiles your code everytime you change something changes to the code can be seen in realtime.</description></item></channel></rss>
