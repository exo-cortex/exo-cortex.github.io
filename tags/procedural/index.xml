One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item><item><title>advanced visualization studio</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 11:35:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</guid><description>A looooooong time ago in the year 2006 I began to play around with AVS. Advanced Visualization Studio came as a plugin with the famous Winamp Media player. Winamp had 2 plugins that rendered colorful procedural art that reacted to the music. These music visualization plugins were &amp;ldquo;Milkdrop&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AVS&amp;rdquo;. Typically the user would choose from a variety of presets that would then visualize the sound. But in AVS users could actually create their own presets.</description></item></channel></rss>
