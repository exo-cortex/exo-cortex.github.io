Last year I started to build one shelf to fit all my stuff into. The idea had been floating around in my head for around 5 years. The idea was to build a shelf conceptually turned sideways by 90 degrees. Usually shelves consist of vertical wooden planks with horizontal boards between them to put stuff on. This way we can vary the widths of columns of shelves and the heights of each compartment within one column.</description></item></channel></rss>
