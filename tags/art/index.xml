With the help of the official repository 3 putting images on the the display is quite easy. The repository also has code for other e-ink-displays from pimoroni.
inky impressions display showing a photograph of paris With about 85mm x 115mm it is comparable to typical e-reader display sizes. Although the glass leads to a different look compare to the matte e-reader displays.</description></item><item><title>new_job / dark matter</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/new_job/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:18:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/new_job/</guid><description>Last month I started working at Dark Matter in Berlin. Dark matter is an exhibition space showing various kinetic audiovisual art-pieces conceived by Christopher Bauder. They mostly use special DMX-controlled winches to move glowing light-elements precisely up and down. Collectively the winches create moving and morphing objects in space in sync with musical soundscapes. My favourite pieces there involve precicely moving objects in order to create moving objects that take up space.</description></item><item><title>reaction_diffusion_systems</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:46:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</guid><description>Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item><item><title>advanced visualization studio</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 11:35:18 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/blog/advanced_visualization_studio/</guid><description>A looooooong time ago in the year 2006 I began to play around with AVS. Advanced Visualization Studio came as a plugin with the famous Winamp Media player. Winamp had 2 plugins that rendered colorful procedural art that reacted to the music. These music visualization plugins were &amp;ldquo;Milkdrop&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;AVS&amp;rdquo;. Typically the user would choose from a variety of presets that would then visualize the sound. But in AVS users could actually create their own presets.</description></item></channel></rss>
