Here I will try to at least describe it so that I can at least communicate it.
1. changing the way mass accumulates. &amp;ldquo;Mass tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells mass how to move.&amp;quot; John Wheeler
In out universe there is a bi-directional relationship between mass and space. Both influence each other: Mass creates a potential $V(x,y,z)$ which is defined for each point in space and the gradient of the potential $\nabla V$ tells us in which direction gravitational pull is moving this mass.</description></item><item><title>reaction_diffusion_systems</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 12:46:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/reaction_diffusion/</guid><description>Reaction-diffusion systems can model many natural pattern-forming processes.
One very popular reaction-diffusion system is the Gray-Scott model, which consists of 2 coupled partial differential equations: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - u v ^2 + f(1- u) $$ $$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v + u v ^2 - (f + k) v $$
In this model the interaction $u$ and $v$ can be seen as 2 chemicals each with their respective diffusion rates.</description></item></channel></rss>
