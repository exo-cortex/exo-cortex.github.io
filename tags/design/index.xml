Admittedly I got interested in the amp, mainly because of its gorgeous design. While reading up on it1 I discovered that it was tremendously well received when Yamaha introduced it in 1981.

Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above â€” would you immediately see that it isn&amp;rsquo;t round? Most people would subconsciously expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</description></item></channel></rss>
