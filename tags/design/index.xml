Admittedly I got interested in the amp, mainly because of its gorgeous design. While reading up on it1 I discovered that it was tremendously well received when Yamaha introduced it in 1981. Back then it cost 1,200 DM (1,367 Euros in 20212). As I still like to listen to the radio naturally I needed a nice tuner as well.</description></item><item><title>shelf_design_with_python</title><link>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/shelf_design_with_python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 17:02:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://exo-cortex.github.io/projects/shelf_design_with_python/</guid><description>I wanted to build a large shelf for a while.

A few years back I experimented with shapes that are almost round, but not quite yet. Slight Imperfections that become irritations are very interesting for me. Imagine a round mirror, or a picture frame shaped like the object [1] above â€” would you immediately see that it isn&amp;rsquo;t round? Most people would subconsciously expect it to be round or oval and find it to slightly deviate from the norm.</description></item></channel></rss>
