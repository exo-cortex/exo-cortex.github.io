# Rust libraries I often use

As I always seem to forget which library I am using and which version and how they are spelled exactly ...
here's a list:

```toml
# complex numbers
num-complex = "0.4.2"

# pseudo-random number generation
rand = "0.8.5" 

# automatically derive arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, etc) for structs
derive_more = "0.99.0"
```
