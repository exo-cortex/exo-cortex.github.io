How to write a hugo shortcode.
Shortcodes are hugo's way of using little modules of html/css/js-code. 

I just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu4zSaKOY4A) that talks about how to use hugo **shortcodes**. Shortcodes are a way of inserting custom pieces of html into the blog posts. 

Create a folder "./layouts/shortcodes/" and insert an .html-file inside which shall contain the shortcodes.
