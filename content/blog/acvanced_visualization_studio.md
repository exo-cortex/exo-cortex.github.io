A looong time ago - 2006*ish* - I used **AVS** (Advanced Visualization Studio - a music visualization plugin that came with **Winamp**) to create nice visualizations of the music that was being played. AVS is a little programming environment that compiles your code everytime you change something. It was actually the first contact with coding I had. A very sparse community of coders around the world made very nice visualization *presets*. 
Unknowingly I came into contact with a lot of concepts that I would later learn the names of in my physics studies. In AVS I dealt with *vector fields*, *numerical integration* via the euler-method, *matrix-multiplications* (for rotations), *bezier-curves* [1], *reaction-diffusion-systems* and (somehow related) *phase-oscillators* which later became central in my bachelor- and master-thesis.

[1] - my friend [**Grandchild**](https://github.com/grandchild) implemented *bezier-curves* into a preset which I then modified to draw a swarm of colorful lines each responding to its own spectral band in the music.
