Yesterday I got my vaccine. Finally. 
Last night and since I've been feeling quite under the weather. Slight fever, a pumping headache and general drowsiness seems to be part of the general experience. Tomorrow should be better.

update: I got my second dose of vaccination from biontech on 4 august.

update: I got my booster shot (moderna) on 4 january 2022 at the very cool ICC in Berlin.
