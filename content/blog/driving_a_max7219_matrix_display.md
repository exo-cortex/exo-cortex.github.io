After initial difficulties with embedded rust -especially deciphering the dense code in the *embedded-hal* [^1] (and giving up multiple times) a few months ago I kept on it this time. I know actually understand some things. 

The *embedded HAL* i.e. the "embedded hardware abstraction layer" is a wonderful project that makes it possible to write software relatively easily.
