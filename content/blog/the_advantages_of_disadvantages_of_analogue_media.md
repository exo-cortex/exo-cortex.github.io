# inconvenience can be a hidden feature

The inconveniences of old (mostly) analogue media increase their contents' relevancy. Modern technology empowers us to carry Terrabytes with us and transfer gigantic amounts of data within seconds - at no cost.



I recently bought an old music cassette player deck. Why? Because cassettes are inconvenient... let me explain: 

# A vinyl record cannot do something that a digital one cannot. 
A vinyl record is great, because it can do *less*.

I've had discussions about analogue versus digital audio over the years. When I started ripping CDs, tagging, organizing and storing the files on my computer I learned about the *Loudness War*[^1], because newer albums seemed be louder than older ones. Especially throught the early 2000s albums got *incredibly* loud. Simultaneously vinyl records became more popular again with people praising their audio quality. A rather difficult claim to make - especially as there is mostly only one type of vinyl, whereas digital audio comes in many different shapes and forms. 

Vinyl is not better, because it can do things that digital media cannot. Digital audio has long surpassed audio quality of any analog medium. But with digital audio musicians (audio producers, engineers, mastering engineers) are allowed a lot of bad decisions which vinyl records simply forbid. A digitally clipped audio file would make the needle jump out of the groove if it were put on vinyl. Audio files that are *physically impossible* on a vinyl record are regularily put on digital media. Clipped audio isn't just bad audio quality, but it can harm your stereo and most importantly *our ears*. 


Vinyl records as a DJ have many obvious downsides: They are more expensive than digital, take up physical space and are heavy. Now that I'm older I see all of these downsides as a positive. When I hear a DJ play on vinyl I can directly see a few things:

1. the DJ knows this track well and considers it *great*
(because he wouldn't have spend real money on an unknown or mediocre track)
2. for tonight s\*he selected *this* record among only a limited number of others for this evening.
3. s\*he carried its weight to the venue

# Mechanical typewriters: they're good, because my fingers hurt 

I have an old traveller's typewriter ("Torpedo") that is probably about 90 years old. I still use it sometimes. Typing on it is real work! Every keystroke is work and after a few minutes my fingers hurt. If I type one mistake I cannot erase the error and have to start over completely with a fresh piece of paper. The physical labor of typing anything on this machine forces me first and foremost to ask "is it worth it?". A mechanically typed text by definition is something I consider important. Proof of work.

# Analogue media forces you to consider what you are doing

Recently I stood next to 2 Pioneer DJ-CD-Players. Those machines that try to resemble a vinyl player but are fully digital and made to play from a USB stick. They are complicated and powerfull technology. DJs can come to a gig equipped only with one (single) USB-stick (as both players are connected via Ethernet each player can access the USB-stick's data).

Advantages of digital medium: 
- thousands of tracks on a single usb-stick.
- a display indicates loudness / bpm / content 
- the DJ can even play tracks not heard before and align them rhythmically through help of the device

Disadvantage of digital medium:
The DJ
- doesn't need to bring "the best" tracks - DJ just brings everything
- doesn't know the songs. Can play even songs unheard before


What are the disadvantages of vinyl records as a DJ?
