Last month I started working at [Dark Matter](darkmatter.berlin) in Berlin. Dark matter is an exhibition space showing various kinetic audiovisual art-pieces conceived by [Christopher Bauder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bauder). They mostly use special DMX-controlled winches to move glowing light-elements precisely up and down. Collectively the winches create moving and morphing objects in space in sync with musical soundscapes. 
My favourite pieces there involve precicely moving objects in order to create moving objects that take up space. Together with a small team I keep track of various tech-related day-to-day-tasks; from starting the system, keeping an eye on the various pieces during the day to shutting it down again. During the off-days maintenance keeps us busy. 

One benefit of this work place is the possibility to make very unique photographs.

The red wave is just one example of what the **GRID** can look like.

I am very excited right now. A lot of advanced technology in the service of beautiful art pieces makes the job very interesting.
