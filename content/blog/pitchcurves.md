**idea**: creating sound from *pure functions*.  
The most elemental wave-forms are sine functions.

Every sound in nature can be deconstructed into a collection of sine functions. A single sine function can only be deconstructed into itself and is therefor called "pure". 

Some years ago I had the idea of constructing "sound emoji" - abstract representations of emotions through sound. The idea was to create short sound of ~1s that can deliver an emotion with the most basic means. In my case a sine wave that changes its frequency.
