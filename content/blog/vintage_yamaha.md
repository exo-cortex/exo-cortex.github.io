# love at first sight

Last month got two pieces of very old audio equipment off of eBay-kleinanzeigen. Admittedly I mostly got interested in the amp, because of its *gorgeous* design. While reading up on it[^1] I discovered that it was tremendously well received when Yamaha introduced it in 1981. Then it cost 1,200 DM (1,367 Euros in 2021[^2]). As I still like to listen to the radio naturally I needed a nice tuner as well.

Presently I am thinking about also getting a cassette deck of the same design line. The Yamaha K-350 cassette player would fit perfectly. Unfortunately finding cassette players of that age that still work flawlessly seems to be difficult. Maybe I will have to familiarize myself with repairing/cleaning an older cassette deck[^3].

Seeing this great piece of equipment in action also makes me a little sad; that most of today's audio/video products will *not* be as long-lasting as these almost 40 year old pieces of hardware is not a good thing.
