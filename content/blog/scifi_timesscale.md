A while ago I read some "hard" science fiction from Charles Stross where he was counting time in kilo-, mega- and gigaseconds. I had to calculate the times each number represented and/or look them up somewhere else in the book. Recently I thought that a nice visualization of these scales might make a good bookmark that people could use.

I added a few time units as well as some extra pieces of information - like the time it takes for light to travel certain distances.

Feel free to download this scale. Once I tidy up my code a little I might publish the source code as well (I made it with Rust as an exercise.)
