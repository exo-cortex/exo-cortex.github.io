For years I have had difficulties with contemporary art: The majority of it is too complicated in order to be relevant. There are three statements I want to make and address afterwards:

1. there exist only a small number of simple forms 
2. effective art uses simple forms
3. new art needs to use complicated forms in order to be new.

## simple forms 
The word *form* is used very abstract here. It can be interpreted as: geometric forms / shapes, forms of movement, sounds, textures etc. Let's build a little intuition about what simple means:

A simple shape has few parameters that describe it. For example: the shape of a disc is extremely simple.
