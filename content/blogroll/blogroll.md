other blogs that I recommend checking out:

# https://www.antipope.org/charlie/
[Charles Stross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross) is a Scottish science-fiction writer that i highly recommend. When I read his novel "Accelerando" it kept me awake several nights, because my mind was processing all the incredible ideas that Stross compressed into this book. It is one of the best books i ever read. Charles Stross also has a long-running blog where he regularily writes about his literary work, interesting science-fiction ideas and also about current (mostly british) politics. His perspective on current affairs are always very insightful and entertaining to read. I highly recommend it.
