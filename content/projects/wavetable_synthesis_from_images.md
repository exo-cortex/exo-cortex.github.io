Any sound can become a tone if we repeat it very quickly. The repetition rate becomes the base-frequency of that tone. If we repeat the sample of a basedrum with **1 Hz** the base frequency is **1 Hz** - well below our hearing range. If we increase the repetition rate to **50 Hz** we can actually here it. 

wavetable synthesis works by playing a very short audio sample on repeat.
