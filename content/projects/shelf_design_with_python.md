I wanted to build a large shelf for a while. 
The shelf should be irregular in its compartment sizes with some of them sticking out more. It shall be really big as to finally store ALL(tm) my stuff that otherwise just lies around all the time.

I began rewriting a python script and put it on github [1]. The script will be updated.
